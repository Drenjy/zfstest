Overview

The Solaris Test Framework (STF) is a test harness - a collection of software
that builds, configures, executes, unconfigures, cleans and packages tests in
a standard way. STF provides the framework needed to develop and execute test
suites for Solaris technology in a consistent manner. 

STF contains the following features:

* Commands for building (stf_build), configuring (stf_configure), executing 
(stf_execute) and unconfiguring (stf_unconfigure) test suites and tools
* Makefile support that defines macros and targets helpful for test development
* Support for assertion-based testing and standard result codes
* Standard build environment that can be customized if needed
* Support for building and running on all Solaris-supported platforms
* Configurable timeout values for test case execution
* Journaling interfaces for complete, parsable test suite logging
* Support for running tests as regular user and super user
* Support for test-case specific setup and cleanup
* Seamless integration with STC 2.0 packaging and checkenv features
* Journal parsing tool (stf_filter)
* Extensible user-defined execution modes
* Support for table-driven testing and automated test case generation
* Support for synchronized execution of multi-system tests (mstf)

===============================================================================

Installing the Package

To install the STF package, use the following command as super user:

	% pkgadd -d <package location>  SUNWstc-stf

Where <package location> refers to the path containing the SUNWstc-stf
package directory. This will install STF into the /opt/SUNWstc-stf
directory.

===============================================================================

Removing the Package

It is recommended that you install the package from scratch, rather than on
top of an existing installation.  Thus, if an old version of the package is
present use the following command as super user to remove the package:

        % pkgrm SUNWstc-stf

===============================================================================

Building the Package (Optional)

If you need to create the STF package from the source code use the following
steps:

	# build STF proto area (See Note 1 below)
	% cd <workspace_path>/usr/src/tools/stf
	% make

	# set path to STF bin directory
	% PATH=<workspace_path>/proto/tools/stf/bin/`uname -p`:$PATH
	% export PATH

	# build STF package
	% stf_build package

The binaries will be located in the proto area at:
<workspace_path>/proto/tools/stf

The SUNWstc-stf package will be located at:
<workspace_path>/packages/`uname -p`

Overview

checkenv is a harness-independent tool which provides a framework for a test
suite to define and verify its test requirements.  All test suites have
requirements that must be met before they can be built, configured or executed.
For some test suites, the requirements can be simple, such as the installation
of core Solaris components with a common build environment. However, for many
test suites, the requirements can be complex. For example, tests suites may
depend upon the availability of one or more of the following:

	* a minimum number of CPUs on the system
	* extra network interfaces
	* a minimum number of spare disk partitions
	* packages not in core Solaris
	* non-standard application software 
	* non-basic Solaris configurations (ie. non-global zones)

checkenv provides a standard way to check for such dependencies.

===============================================================================

Installing the Package

To install the checkenv package, use the following command as super user:

	% pkgadd -d <package location>  SUNWstc-checkenv

Where <package location> refers to the path containing the SUNWstc-checkenv 
package directory. This will install checkenv into the /opt/SUNWstc-checkenv
directory.

===============================================================================

Removing the Package

It is recommended that you install the package from scratch, rather than on
top of an existing installation.  Thus, if an old version of the package is
present use the following command as super user to remove the package:

        % pkgrm SUNWstc-checkenv

===============================================================================

Building the Package (Optional)

If you need to create the checkenv package from the source code use the 
following steps:

	# set path to STF bin directory
	% PATH=<path-to-STF>/bin/`uname -p`:$PATH
	% export PATH

	# build checkenv proto area and package 
	% cd <workspace_path>/usr/src/tools/checkenv
	% make package

The binaries will be located in the proto area at:
<workspace_path>/proto/tools/checkenv

The SUNWstc-checkenv package will be located at:
<workspace_path>/packages/`uname -p`

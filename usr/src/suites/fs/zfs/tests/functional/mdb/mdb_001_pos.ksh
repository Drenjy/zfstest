# ID: mdb_001_pos
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#	Verify that the ZFS mdb dcmds and walkers are working as expected.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1) Given a list of dcmds and walkers
#	2) Step through each element of the list
#	3) Verify the output by checking for "mdb:" in the output string
#
# TESTABILITY: explicit
#
# TEST_AUTOMATION_LEVEL: automated
#
# CODING_STATUS: COMPLETED (2006-10-11)

# DESCRIPTION:
#	Set/Unset autoreplace, remove device from redundant pool and insert new
#	device, this new device state will be indicated as 'ONLINE/UNAVAIL'. 
#	No FMA faulty message.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Create mirror/raidz/raidz2 pool.
#	2. Synchronise with device in the background.
#	3. Set autoreplace=on
#	4. Remove device from pool and insert a new device.
#	5. Verify the new devices status is 'ONLINE'.
#	6. Verify that no FMA faults have been generated.
#	7. Set autoreplace=off, redo steps 4 - 6, verify the new device's
#	   status is 'UNAVAIL'. There are FMA faulty.

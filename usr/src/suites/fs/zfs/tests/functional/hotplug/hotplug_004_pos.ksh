# DESCRIPTION:
#	When device replacement fails, the original device's state will be
#	'UNAVAIL' and an FMA fault will be generated.
#
# STRATEGY:
#	1. Create mirror/raidz/raidz2 pool.
#	2. Synchronise with device in the background.
#	3. Create a small device which is smaller than the minimal ZFS device.
#	4. Replace one device with the small device.
#	5. Verify the device replacement failed
#	6. Verify that an FMA fault was generated
#

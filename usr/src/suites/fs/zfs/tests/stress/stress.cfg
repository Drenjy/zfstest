# we're setting a huge STF timeout here, however the stress tests
# are governed by the STRESS_TIMEOUT value below. The reason being,
# that we don't mind stress tests running as far as the timeout -
# they still pass, whereas if we hit the STF_TIMEOUT, we mark the
# test as failed - which we don't want. If stress tests are hung or
# slow, then we wait at most 60 mins.
#
export STF_TIMEOUT=3600

# As per the note above, to avoid hitting the STF_TIMEOUT,
# the value of STRESS_TIMEOUT must be < STF_TIMEOUT. Currently 30 mins.
